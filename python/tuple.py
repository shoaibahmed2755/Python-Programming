# tuple : collection of heterogenious type of data which is indexed
# ordered, it is immutable (unchangeable), 
# creating a tuple we need to use parentheses () and we can't change the value of tuple after it is created.
# example: a=(2,4,5.3,...ETC)
# tuple is faster than list because it is immutable.
# tuple is more memory efficient than list because it is immutable.
